# A Simple Dedicated Server Handler
I wanted to make a simple dedicated server handler for me and my buddies, so we can make multiplayer games without the hassle of adding these scripts like a million times!

## What is in this repo?
In here is a basic scene with connecting to LAN or to a dedicated server of your choosing.

## Does this have a dedicated server connected to it?
**THIS DOES NOT HAVE A DEDICTAED SERVER CONNECTED TO IT**. This project is assuming you already have a dedicated server as either a cloud server or as a home server.

## Is this a tutorial?
No. This does have comments telling you what the functions do, but if you have this project i'm assuming that you know atleast a little on how multiplayer works in games.
